# datafun-05-sql
This project completes a part of the requirements of datafun-05-sql

The project uses these packages from the Python Standard Library:

- pathlib - to work with folders and files
- sqlite3 - to work with a Sqlite file-based database

If the virtual environment needs to be avoided, it is possible to use the csv module from the Python Standard Library to read csv files.
